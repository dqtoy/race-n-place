# Basic summary of gameplay
- 2-4 player local multiplayer racing game. Controllers required (mouse and keyboard not supported).
- Gameplay switches between two modes: racing around the track, and placing towers/traps
- Players collect resource (scrap) to be able to build objects during placement mode. Gears can be lost while racing if they collide
  with traps or walls or other players

# Racing Mode
- One lap around the track should take around 30-60 seconds.
- Two laps per round

# Placing mode
- On average, a player will collect enough scrap to place 2 objects (towers/traps).
- Towers exist in the "negative space" outside the track, while traps are placed directly onto the track.
- Towers mechanics could be: shoot straight forward in intervals (1 second of shooting, 2 seconds of not shooting);
                             home in on the nearest target and shoot once it locks on;
                             shoot at the general area of enemies intermittently
                             
- Trap mechanics could be: spikes that shoot upwards intermittently or shortly after a vehicle drives onto it;
                           ramps that are just ramps
                           flame jets
                           crawler mines
                           
                           
- Effects of getting hit by a tower or trap: getting knocked around, spinning out, speed decrease, dropping scrap, vehicle damage that eventually blows up your car


#Vehicle damage
Vehicles can get destroyed if they take enough damage. The player will not respawn for that round. Rounds are short enough that players shouldn't mind having to 'sit out' for a very short period of time if they get blown up.
